# rock-paper-scissors

This project is part of TOP Foundations course. The assignment was to create a rock, paper, scissors game to be played against the computer. 

The assignment was to be built in JavaScript, and for it to be played completely from the console.

First, I created a function to get the computer choice for the game. 
Using the JS built in math.random I was able to generate a random number and assign it to a game unit to indicate the computers choice.

Next, the player function had to be created to accept input from the user upon the page load. 

In order for the game to be played, a function to play a single round was needed to put the computer and user input against each other to see who would win. 

Lastly, another function was created to loop through 5 rounds of the game, total the scores, and to declare the game champion.
